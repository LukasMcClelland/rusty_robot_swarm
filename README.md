Rusty Robot Swarm is a modified reimplementation of the swarm robotics simulation I made for my honours project in senior year of 
university. But, this time I'm writing the whole thing in Rust instead of Python! 

Using Python the first time around was excellent as it led to rapid development and proof of concept/prototyping. 
However, the whole simulation ran a little too slowly for my taste, so this project is a great way to learn a new language and see a fun project run faster.


Early development snip (just about to put each robot into its own thread!)
